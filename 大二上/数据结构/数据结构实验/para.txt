Binary search trees were introduced in Chapter 5. In this section, we consider the construction of binary search trees for a static set of elements. That is, we make no additions to or deletions from the set. Only searches are performed. A sorted list can be searched using a binary search. For this search, we can construct a binary search tree with the property that searching this tree using the function Get (Program 5.19) is equivalent to performing a binary search on the sorted list. For instance, a binary search on the sorted element list (5,10,15) (for convenience, all examples in this chapter show only an element's key rather than the complete element) corresponds to using algorithm Get on the binary search tree of Figure 10.1. Although this tree is a full binary tree, it may not be the optimal binary search tree to use when the probabilities with which different elements are searched are different.
